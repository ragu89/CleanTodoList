# CleanTodoList

This is a proposition of a Clean Architecture for iOS projects.

It's based on the MVVM pattern and is powered by [Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine).
The dependency injection is made with [Resolver](https://github.com/hmlongco/Resolver).

This project contains two UI implementations : One with UIKit and one with SwiftUI. Both are using the same ViewModels.
